<p>wxpymoo (pronounced "wispy-moo") is a wxPython MOO client, very work-in-progress.  It's intended to run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux/etc.</p>

<p>This is a response to Andrew Wilson's fantastic <a href="http://www.awns.com/tkMOO-light">tkMOO-light</a> MOO client being basically abandoned, and tk-based, which is uugly, and coded in TCL which I find eye-stabbingly difficult to work with.  So I thought I'd see if I could reproduce the 75% of it that I use, in Perl which I understand, and Wx which looks like something even remotely from the 21st century, and so forth.</p>

<p>Which I did.</p>

<p>And then started discovering how difficult it is to package and release wxPerl applications.</p>

<p>So I punted, and reimplemented the entire thing in wxPython.  And here we are.</p>

<h2>
<a id="done" class="anchor" href="#done" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Done:</h2>

<ul>
<li>It connects to a MOO.  Initially, it defaults to my MOO at hayseed.net:7777, specifically, but the Worlds-&gt;Connect dialog now works to connect wherever you like, and it'll remember your last-connected MOO and reconnect there automatically, if you set the preference to.</li>
<li>It takes input, and shows output.  Almost pleasantly, even.</li>
<li>The input field has a super-basic but functional command history.</li>
<li>ANSI color/style codes are supported.</li>
<li>Partial <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/mcp2.html">MCP/2.1</a> implementation -- mcp-negotiate is implemented;  mcp-cord is only partially.</li>
<li>Starting in on MCP packages:

<ul>
<li>dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit (external editor configurable)</li>
<li>dns-com-awns-serverinfo</li>
<li>dns-com-vmoo-client</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Saving prefs works, for the small set of prefs it honors.  Lots of work intended here, still.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="01-milestone" class="anchor" href="#01-milestone" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>0.1 Milestone:</h2>

<ul>
<li>fix output pane scroll-to-bottom behavior to dwym</li>
<li>More keyboard accelerators;  page-up/down etc

<ul>
<li>TODO - probably make several profiles (vi-like, emacs-like, windows-like) or maybe just actually expose ways to bind your own choices to everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="to-do" class="anchor" href="#to-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To do:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add proper prefs and world/connection handling (85% done!)</li>
<li>Actually support multiple simultaneous connections (80% done)</li>
<li>Pondering schemes to scrape online MOO lists to offer suggestions. (70% done!)</li>
<li>Start making sure it works on Windows and MacOS.  (Has been demonstrated to work at all on Windows, woot.)</li>
<li>Start rolling binary packages for all platforms once it's remotely useful to anyone but me.</li>
<li>Customizable colors / themes (currently you can have any colors you want as long as they're solarized-dark.)</li>
<li>Per-world settings?  Colors, fonts?</li>
<li>Complete the MCP 2.1 implementation.  It does the version dance with the server (both the MCP version, and mcp-negotiate package-version), but ignores whatever it sees.  Also mcp-cord isn't tested/usable at all.</li>
<li>object browser, like MacMOOSE but hopefully nicer.</li>
<li>Connections will hopefully have a 'connection type' -- currently thinking in terms of plain'ol TCP port, SSL, and SSH port forwarding (automagic at connection time).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="blue-sky" class="anchor" href="#blue-sky" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blue-sky:</h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML help, using jtext?</li>
<li>MIME-based external apps, ie mplayer for audio/flac etc?  MCP package to accept MIME+data?</li>
<li>inline MOO syntax highlighting?  Like, detect the output of "<a href="https://github.com/list" class="user-mention">@list</a> $player:tell" and auto-highlight it?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>tkMOO-light has a whole plugin architecture, and all sorts of third-party additions (I even wrote one, years ago).  I'm not delusional enough to think that there'll be a flourishing ecosystem of developers around <strong>this</strong> MOO client, so I'm not actually desigining with that in mind.  (Update:  MCP packages are now plugin-able.)</li>
<li>I MOO socially, occasionally.  I don't do RPG MUDs or things like that, so I have no need for triggers and macros and so forth.  I don't even have a clear idea of what people do with them.  Convince me.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="guiding-thoughts" class="anchor" href="#guiding-thoughts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guiding thoughts:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Monospaced fonts and line-based terminal output are not mutually incompatible with intuitive, pleasant UIs.</li>
<li>There are many wheels out there that have been invented well already.  My MOO client doesn't need its own built-in text editor.  Lather, rinse, repeat.</li>
<li>Nobody's living on a shell account on a VMS machine.  The MOO doesn't need to be a black-and-white culdesac.  There are dozens of interesting things a MOO client could do, connected to the 21st-century Internet, that I haven't thought of yet.  Detect chat in a different language and offer to translate?  Tweet you when your friends log on?  Display Google Maps for a MOO that knows how to host that?  Who knows.</li>
</ul>
